# Drinking game

## This is just a fun little project, bugs and awful error handling are expected.

### Game logic
- Draw a card.
- Every suit has a game associated, if the joker is drawn every player loses.
    - Hearts: would you rather.
    - Diamonds: never have i ever.
    - Clubs: trivia.
    - Spades: truth or dare.
- The player(s) that lose the game has to drink.
- Rinse and repeat until you either finish the deck or the alcohol.
